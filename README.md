# DynamicWebProject
Dynamic storefront application using Java EE and JSP

Screenshots in root directory show gist of project's capabilities and purpose. Login screen accepts username and password, creates session, then renders page with dynamically generated web content on store page. Logout clears session and returns to login page. Clicking "more info" under each car loads a page with further information about the vehicle, also dynamically generated.
